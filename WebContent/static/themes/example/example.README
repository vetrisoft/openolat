The example theme is a very simple theme based on the default theme. 
You can use it to build your own theme so you don't have to start 
from scratch. 

The example theme does modify only little things, most elements are 
defined in the default theme, which is included in the first lines of 
the theme. Make sure you read the themes.README provided in the 
themes directory before you start modifying any files or writing your
own theme. 

A last piece of advice: keept it simple, don't change too much :-)
