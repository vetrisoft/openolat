chelp.reflexion.intro=A reflection is an examination of passed events or ongoing processes and should be unemotional. To reflect means to evaluate from a distance how e.g. a task has been performed, how one has dealt with oneself, with a certain situation, or how one has acted within a group, etc. When learning with portfolios this kind of written reflection is very important. Each lerner has to think about his or her own personal learning progress, about the amount of interest or concern, as well as about how the knowledge acquired can be used. Judgements such as «This was good, that wasn't interesting, etc.» should not be mentioned in reflections. A good reflection is an important step towards learning with a high degree of personal responsibility.
