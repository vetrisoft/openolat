Spring offers ways to create objects and access them without the need of any xml and also non lists where you have to register/list the classes


@Component
class MyType implements MyDemoType...



List<MyDemoType> list = springContext.getBeansByType(MyDemoType.class)

or you can also let spring inject all Objects of a certain type with @Autowire

@Autowire
List<MyDemoType> list 


The benefit of this approach is that you do not have to edit any lists when programmers implement new objects of your interface
