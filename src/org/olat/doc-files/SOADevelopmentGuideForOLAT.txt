Controller
------------------

o Keep business code out of the controllers!
o Do not offer public or static methods from any controller
o A package with several controllers should provide a PackageGUIFactory (this is also a good place to inject your services into the controllers)
o The GUI Factory only returns Objecs of type Controller




Service Level
------------------
o Services belong to the LMS package

Spring
-------------------
o Use Spring to create your objects

Database Access
--------------------
o The data layer only contain code that accesses the database or the filesystem. All methods that use other services or other DAO objects belong to the service layer.
