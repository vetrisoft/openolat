<h2>Overview: mappers and static file handling</h2>
Brasato offers two ways to deliver files to the browser: 
<ol>
<li><a href="#dispatcher">Via dispatcher</a></li>
<li><a href="#mapper">Via mapper</a></li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="dispatcher">Dispatcher: static application files</h3>
<p>
To deliver static files that are part of the application brasato offers
two concepts. Both are implemented using the brasato dispatcher
interface:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Files in webapp/static*</li>
<li>Files in your.package._static/</li>
</ol>
<p>
The first mechanism is used to embedd general framework resources, e.g.
css files, themes and basic javascript files. Those files are normally
embedded directly in body.html. Those files are deliverd using the
<code>StaticMediaDispatcher</code> class.
</p>
<p>The second mechanism is used to embedd component based resources,
e.g. some js code, images or css classes only used by a certain
component. The component can be part of the brasato framework, be in the
application sourcecode or even aded to the application as a jar.
</p>
<p>
Those resources are delivered using the <code>ClassPathStaticDispatcher</code>
</p>
<h4>Browser caches and version id</h4>
<p>Files delivered by the the StaticMediaDispatcher or the
ClassPathStaticDispatcher always have the same URL to make those file
cachable by the browser. Since those files don't change between
releases, it's entirely up to the browser how to cache them. OLAT
implements the last-modified date to optimize browser or proxy server
caching of those files.
</p>
<p>However, to force users to reload all resources after a new release,
the path contains the application version flag. Thus, after a new
release, all resources will be loaded from scratch by all browsers. This
mechanismus is implemented transparently, you don't have to take care
about it.
</p>
<h4>Mod_jk optimization: static delivery via apache</h4>
Files delivered by the the StaticMediaDispatcher or the
ClassPathStaticDispatcher can alternatively be delivered by apache when
using mod_jk. This is strongly recommended on high traffic sites since
apache is optimized for such tasks. To enable this features you must do
the following steps:
<ol>
<li>Configure OLAT with Apache and mod_jk</li>
<li>In olat.properties file set server.modjk.enabled=true</li>
<li>
Change mod_jk and httpd.conf configuration to :
<pre>
&lt;IfModule mod_jk.c&gt;
  JkUnMount /olat/raw/* worker1
&lt;/IfModule&gt;

&lt;Directory "/home/cg/workspace/olat3_HEAD/webapp/static/"&gt;
    Options         Indexes IncludesNoExec FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride   None
    Order           allow,deny
    Allow from      all
&lt;/Directory&gt;
Alias /olat/raw/VERSIONID "/home/cg/workspace/olat3_HEAD/webapp/static/"
</pre>
See olat/conf/httpd.conf for an example
</li>
<li>Restart OLAT (can take a while on first startup when jsmath images are deployed)</li>
</ol>


<h3><a name="mapper">Mapper: dynamic (content) files</h3>
<p>
While the delivery of static resources via the dispatchers described
above is a service infrastructure of the framework, the mapper comes in
place when you want to have control over the delivery process (e.g a
protected resource) or the delivered files are generated on the fly
(e.g. an excel file download).
</p>
<h4>Registration</h4>
<p>Mappers must be registered using the mapper registry or the global
mapper registry. The difference between global and normal is that
globals mappers have a global mapper name based on the class that
registered for the mapper. Thus, the global mapper will always have the
same URL and can be cached by the browser.  Global mappers are shared between all users. Make sure you implement a
proper last-modified in the resources you deliver via global mappers!
</p>
<p>The normal mapper registry registers for user session based mappers.
The life-time of such mappers is bound to the user session.
</p>
<h4>Deregistration</h4>
<p>Make sure you unregister the mappers you register. Use the
BasicController to work with mappers and use the convenience methods
there to register mappers
</p>
<p>Note that global mappers don't need to be unregistered. They are
registered only once in a class and cleaned up when the applicatoin
shuts down.</p>
