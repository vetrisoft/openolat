<h4>Panel 2</h4>
<p>
A panel is simply a container so we can put almost anything into a panel.
Let's see how our form of the Form Demo is doing in a pane.
We'll include the same form again in this pane just below this intro text.
This also demonstrates re-usability of components.

$r.render("paneform")
