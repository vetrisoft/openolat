This shows how a component can include css and js needed.
<br><br>
<fieldset>
<legend>a div class with a background image</legend>
a sun icon should be visible to the left of "style 1"
<div class="cssjsdemostyle1">style 1</div>
The css also overrides the color of the body element - you should see red fonts which must disappear when the modal dialog is closed

</fieldset>
<br>
clicking the link should show an alert.
<br>
<a href="javascript:testsub1()">A link calling the function testsub1</a>
<br>
<a href="javascript:cssjsdemo_test()">A first test should show an alert</a>
