Usage of CoreSpringFactory


o Try not to use the CoreSpringFactory (use autowiring) at all but in the meantime there are cases where you have to.

o Do not use CoreSpingFactory in Spring-managed classes ! 
  (you will have an assert-exception)

o Whenever possible use CoreSpringFactory.getBean(ServiceInterface.class) and not just pass a string name (refactor save...) 
  Needs no casting to requested type (since 15.6.2011).
  
o New method  'CoreSpringFactory.getService(ServiceInterface.class)' : Check if requested type is with '@Service' annoteted
  Decision 16.6.2011 (LD,GS,CG) : We will not use this method in layer-refactoring (until service-orientation)
