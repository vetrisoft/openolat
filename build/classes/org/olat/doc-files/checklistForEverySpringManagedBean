What should you check if you created a new spring managed bean
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

o no public constructor
	
	Spring can create even objects with private constr. so to have package access (unit test) you should use default or protected modifiers.
	The problem with public access it that people will create your objects and your spring annotations or init stuff will not be done at all.

o try to avoid an xml context file
	
	Most stuff can be done without xml, see the basicAnnotations.txt file

o try to avoid setters
	
	Setters are often just boilerplate code and can be replaced with package visible fields with the @Autowired annotation.
	Those fields can be access directly while doing testing and setting mocks

o try to avoid lists of beans in xml
	see the docu file creatingObjectsOfSameTypeWithSpring.
	As you can access all spring beans of a certain type and even inject them into a property there is no need for xml file and analyze those list

o  If possible do not access your beans over the CoreSpringFactory

	see corespringfactoryUsage.txt
	
o do only work in the constructor which does not depend on any other spring stuff as it will be injected after construction time
